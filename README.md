# RAG
This repository implements a modern, enterprise-style Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built entirely with free and open-source models. The system supports multi-source knowledge retrieval, conversational memory, and hybrid search (internal + web) using a clean, auditable architecture aligned with the latest LangChain (LCEL) design.
